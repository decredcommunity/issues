# Labels

Issues are marked with 'labels' or tags that can be used for filtering. [Here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels) is a list of all labels and their descriptions.

Example filters:

* [active issues](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/active)
* [article ideas](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/article)
* [issues assigned to a person](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues?q=assignee%3Axaur+is%3Aopen)

# Privacy

GitHub is more "public" than [chats](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+decred:decred.org) because it is easier indexed by search engines. Also, GitHub has public event streams that many parties are subscribed to.

There is a trade-off. Public issue tracker allows better coordination where your ideas and work can gain visibility and attract contributors, at the cost of some privacy.

# Funding

**Disclaimer**: maintainers of this repository do not promise to fund work on issues.

The tracker is a tool to collect ideas, coordinate execution and track progress.

It is up to you to seek funding for work on any issue.

Currently, the primary tool to seek funding from Decred Treasury is [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/) (guidelines [here](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeia.md)). However, Politeia is designed for big decisions and it is not recommended to bother all stakeholders with minutiae.

If you feel someone might be interested in funding your work, feel free to ask around in [chats](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+decred:decred.org).

A more standard workflow to fund smaller work items is an [open discussion](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/33).
